					<p> I made this website in about three hours, including the backend. The backend is written in Node.JS and ExpressJS, and deployed on an Nginx webserver (it is on my old laptop). While it may not look pleasing to the eye this is just because I am not much of a visual designer, while I do understand how to program for styling. I am more comfortable writing fast, reliable and powerful backend code. </p>
